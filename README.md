# Cellular Automata – Game of Life

This project is an implementation of **Conway's Game of Life** using Java and Swing. The primary focus is on the core logic of cellular automata rather than user interface design.

## Features

- Graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing
- Load and save custom game states
- Start, pause, and step through the simulation
- Basic interaction with the cell grid

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command-line tools

### Running the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Run the `main` method in `GameController.java`.
4. A window will open where you can interact with the Game of Life simulation.

## Notes

- The UI is minimal and functional — visual design was not a project focus.
- Saved states are stored as individual files in the `Configs/` directory.
- You can save a new configuration through the GUI and reload it later.
